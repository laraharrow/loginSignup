# Login Signup frontend

## This is the frontend of our login/signup app.

###### On this part of the application we are using:

`React: `
**Used to create static components for pages: `navbar` - `landing` - `login` - `register`**

`Redux: `
**Global state management. Used to manage the state between components**

`Redux-thunk:`
**Redux middleware. Used to allow direct access to the `dispatch` method that makes asynchronous call from actions**

`React-Redux:`
**Allows the use of Redux with React**

`React-router-dom:`
**Used to support routing within the app**

`Axios:`
**Used to facilitate a promise based HTTP requests from the client to the backend**

`Classnames:`
**Used for conditional classes in our `JSX`**

`jwt-decode:`
**Used to decode out `JSON WEB TOKEN` making possible to access user data**

######NOTE:
> This project doesn't require `Redux`. But I decided to use it to express the capabilities of a more functional application using the MERN stack. Once in the industry a  large-scale project following the MERN stack can take advantage of the use of `Redux`.
